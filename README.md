# Route-Execution

Part of the Autonomous Warehouse project in which we had to use NXT Robots in order to simulate a real warehouse.
My part in this project was to create the route execution (given a route the robot should be able to go to the location of an item).
In order to do this I used a listener system for the sensors of the robot and we were provided with an API in which we had the commands for the robot.
